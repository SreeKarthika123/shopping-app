I have developed an e-commerce website with functionalities for both admins and users. The admin has the ability to add and manage products on the platform, while users can sign in, browse, and purchase items. The website is built using Node.js and Express.js for the backend, React.js for the frontend, and MongoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval.
TO RUN THE PROGRAM: npm run dev
